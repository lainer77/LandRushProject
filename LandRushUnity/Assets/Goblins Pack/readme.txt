This pack contains a set of goblins, ready to march off into battle or cause mayhem. It comes with 4 different classes as well as a base goblin class.

- Warrior Goblin
- Shaman Goblin
- Worker Goblin
- Archer Goblin
- Simple Goblin

All items such as swords, armor, arm bands and helmets can easily be mixed and matched across classes and we've provided a simple item manager script to easily show or remove items at runtime and in editor mode.

To edit items, select the goblin gameobject in the scene and view its Gear script in the inspector. You can tick and untick items to show/hide them and add new items by selecting the plus button at the bottom of the list. To toggle items programmatically at runtime, grab an instance of the Item script you want to toggle (items can be accessed through the gear.Items property) and call its Show(bool show) method. To check if an item is showing, simply call its activeSelf property.

All goblins are mechanim and mixamo ready and we've provided a few sample animations from mixamo.com as a bonus. Each class comes with 2 different body type variations.
